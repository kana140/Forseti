- üîç **Search by part number (MPN)**  
- üß© **Aggregated results** grouped by `partNumber ‚Üí website ‚Üí listings`  
- üìä **Nested supplier breakdowns** including distributor ID, links, and stock levels  
- ‚è± **Asynchronous web scraping** for faster data collection across multiple sources  
- ‚ö° **React/Next.js frontend** with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive UI  
- üñ• **Flask API backend** powered by `aiohttp` + BeautifulSoup
